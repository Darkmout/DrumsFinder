# DrumsFinder
This project aims to write the drums music sheet from an audio source.

I'm unsing a neural network to detect the note in the music. 

Data used to train the network (the data is not in the repository because of space limits) :
- Music bands who are kind enough to give the score of their music :
  - Atlantis Chronicles
- Scores generated for guitar hero like games
  - http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/custom-songs
- [TODO] Generated audio with a drum machine (with humanization)
  - Ezdrummer software
- [TODO] Online database
  - All chart
  - ultimate-guitar
- [TODO] the million song dataset
