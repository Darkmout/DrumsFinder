Deep learning for music, galaxies and plankton

decision tree : depending of the answer to the first question, a specific path will continue among the tree

vanishing gradient : because of the non linearity which "compress" values between -1 & 1 (which was used in the hidden layers). The rectified liearity makes it better

Why do data augmentation in the data by translkating and rotating the iunput instead of doing it in the model by rotating the filter of the convnet ? see benanne sur git-hub

see Oxfordnet model: convolution model wich is great for image recognition

content-based recomendation works less than recommendation from collaborative filtering
t-SNE : algorithm to project in 2D multidimensional points

perceptron = linear classifier ?! = shallow classifier
