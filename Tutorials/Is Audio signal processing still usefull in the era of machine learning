Is Audio signal processing still usefull in the era of machine learning ?

audio source separation (separate speech from noise) usage of dnn is only two years old in this team.

see discriminative training:
try with one hidden layer, then 2 then 3 ... then stop when no more improvment is done

Input of the nn: 
 - raw
 - result from other rnn/ffnn -> what is the difference of creating a dnn with more layers

SEE : realign channel based on TDOA !!!!

voir slide 29 for spectral input features
- Multi-resolution cochleagram (MRCG)
- pitch

seen unsupervised learning
